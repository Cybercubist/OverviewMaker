# OverviewMaker

**The task:** write a small script which will make a snapshot of technical picture of main market assets.

**The solution:** We have created a small script, which evaluates technical picture using **CandleHandle** algorithm.

OverviewMaker shows evals of next assets: <i>crude oil, natural gas, gold, silver, NASDAQ, S&P 500, DJ Utility, Hang Seng, Bitcoin, Ethereum.</i> We chose those assets as far as they should represent the whole market conditions.

For more visual effect we made a table in excel with a good formatting. You can enter CH evals there and get a nice table with technical analysis information of all main world indexes, commodities and assets. That table may be copied and pasted as picture wherever you want!
